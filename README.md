## About

This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.

this project is part of the common core of 42.

## Objectives 

Here are the things you need to know:

• One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.

• The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
  While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
  while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
  and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.

• There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.

• Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a
  philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.

• When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
  start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
  a philosopher dies of starvation.

• Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.

• Philosophers don’t speak with each other.

• Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.

• No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!
